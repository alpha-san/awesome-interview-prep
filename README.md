# awesome-interview-prep
A collection of resources used in my last round of interviewing for my current job

# Intro
If I could only choose one resource for interview prep it would be [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&link_code=qs&qid=1650300933&sourceid=Mozilla-search&sr=8-1). The book hasn't been updated in a while but that's because everything generally still applies. At the very least, the first few chapters are good for behaviorial interview prep.

# Algorithms/Data Structures
This [slideshow](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/visualizing_four_key_interview_algorithms) by Jeremy Aguilon is very helpful. Most algorithm questions I was asked was a variation of these algorithms. 

Also this [set](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score) of questions are very commonly asked.

# Language-specific information
For language-specific information, I've included a collection of Anki decks I've used. 

Note: It's useful to create your own as you learn the material and as you interview.

Here is a list of included anki decks:
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Ruby/Rails
- Rspec
- SQL Interview Questions
- System Design

Note: SQL and System Design are useful if interviewing for mid-senior level positions.

# System Design
System design questions are commonly asked for mid-senior level positions.

My favorite resource for distributed system related prep is [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF) by Alex Xu. I've found it to be more helpful than [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview?aid=5082902844932096&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=grokking-manual&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwvZv0BRA8EiwAD9T2VfUsbyNJ2UWlOyPaRmN2NjmL6TrgpAkqzeVZTYAzq4-nuQDsraYaAhoCdMMQAvD_BwE&aid=5082902844932096&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=dsa_grokking&utm_term=&utm_campaign=%5BTest%5D+Dynamic+Verticals&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5451446008&hsa_cam=14045073269&hsa_grp=133791763082&hsa_ad=584320664281&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=dsa-1287243227699&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmPSSBhCNARIsAH3cYgY8VltugBug-kXMJGShEoGBGqEUk0N43sxy0ew-7CbX0_klY2V0wX4aAkj9EALw_wcB) which gets recommended a lot

# FAANG
Disclaimer: I have interviewed at FAANG companies and know a lot of people who work there but have not worked there.

I believe a good rule of thumb is being able to solve LC mediums in 15-30 min and LC hards at 30-60 min.

Some resources:
- [interview.io](interview.io) - The best way to get at interviews is practicing them
- [Blind 75 LC Questions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) - At the time of writing, this is the best general prep for FAANG
- [Blind app](https://www.teamblind.com/)

The more specific you are with your goals, the better. For instance, if Meta is your goal, search Blind/LeetCode forums for Meta interview questions/experience.
